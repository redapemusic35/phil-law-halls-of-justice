# INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY – DAY 1 (Jan 15)

## The Cave of Wonder

[Project: Cave of Wonder map — dark, mysterious, glowing entrance]

“Welcome to PHIL 101: Introduction to Philosophy and Dungeons and Dragons.

You are about to enter The Cave of Wonder — a dungeon where every room forces you to answer a question philosophers have bled over for 2,500 years. Drink the hemlock or redefine patrotism. Define justice, what are its necessary and sufficient conditions? Who are you *really*?

Here’s the deal:

## No lectures.

You roll dice. You make choices. You question your beliefs. You eat your friend.

This is not a game. It’s a philosophy lab inside an experience machine.

By December, you’ll have lived Socrates, Descartes, Mill, and Rawls — not just read them.

[Hand out pre-gen characters]

Pick one, this is your character for the rest of the course. Write your name on it.

Today, we begin in Room A. A voice echoes:

“What is philosophy?”

Roll a d20. Tell me your answer.”
