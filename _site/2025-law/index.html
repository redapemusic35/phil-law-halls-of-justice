<p>Philosophy requires one to apply principles of reasoning to real dilemmas. In this course, you will enter The Halls of Justice — a living dungeon where every room is a moral crisis, a trial, a prison, or a ticking bomb. You will live Fuller, Hart, Dworkin, and Dershowitz, roll dice, break laws, judge, and be judged — then defend your choices and write a paper on one choice that broke you.</p>
<section id="goals" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals">Goals:</h2>
<p>In general, philosophy requires one to apply principles of reasoning to different philosophical issues. Accordingly, one of my goals in this course is to help you improve your critical reasoning skills. These skills are useful not only with respect to this class, but to other philosophy and law classes as well. A second goal of mine is to teach you some of the fundamental philosophical ideas behind much of that which we call law. We will examine theories which attempt to provide answers to such questions as: What is a law? What makes a law valid or binding? Does one always have a moral obligation to obey the law? What gives society the right to punish people whose actions are harmful only to the individual, him/herself (paternalism)? Does society have the right to harm those who break the law (criminal punishment)? Should attempted crimes be punished less severely than completed crimes? We will not spend much time discussing specific public policy issues such as: Whether raising the drinking age saves lives, whether smoking marijuana is a victimless crime (whether it harms others), or whether the death penalty is a deterrent.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Improve critical reasoning through choice → consequence → argument.</li>
<li>Master fundamental ideas behind law:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>What is a law?</li>
<li>What makes a law valid or binding?</li>
<li>Must we obey unjust laws?</li>
<li>Can society punish self-harm (paternalism)?</li>
<li>Should attempts be punished less than results?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>No policy debates (e.g., drinking age, marijuana). We ask: What ought the law to be?</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="learning-objectives" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<ol type="1">

<li>Defend positions using primary texts.</li>

</ol>
<section id="evaluated-activities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluated-activities">Evaluated Activities</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on the following scale:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>A =</td>
<td>360 and above</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>B =</td>
<td>320-359</td>

<td>D =</td>
<td>240-279</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<p>Four primary factors will go into determining your grade:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<section id="quizzes" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quizzes">Quizzes</h4>
<p>At the beginning of most class sessions, I will present the class with a quiz. Quizzes will be based on the assigned readings and/or the discussion from the previous class. Each quiz is worth six points (maximum), and I will give a total of nineteen quizzes. I will drop the two lowest scored quizzes. Since I include in your total-quiz-grade seventeen quizzes at six points per quiz, the total points possible on quizzes is 102. If you should earn more than one-hundred points on quizzes, all additional points count as extra credit. Finally, since I give quizzes at the beginning of class, arriving to class on time is essential. I will not repeat the quiz question(s) after the first person has turned in her/his quiz. If you arrive late or are absent, you receive a zero for the quiz. I do give partial credit for quizzes, and just putting your name on the top is worth two points.</p>
<p>(I may decide to ask the class to write some short “reaction papers” – one to two pages – in place of some quizzes. Each of the papers, like the quizzes, will be worth six points. If you are not present in class, you may miss these assignments.)</p>
<p>You will need to bring one three-by-five-inch index card to each class period during which there is a quiz.</p>
</section>
<section id="paper" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="paper">Paper</h4>
<p>You are required to write one paper, which must be type-written, double-spaced, and eight to ten pages in length. Approximately four to six weeks before the paper is due, I will upload several essays to Canvas, and each student must choose ONE to which s/he will respond. If you wish to write a paper on a topic other than one of those suggested by me, you must clear it with me. (I will be more than happy to approve relevant topics.)</p>
<p>The papers you write are not opinion papers. It is standard practice among philosophers to view mere opinion to be worth less than the energy used to express it. What is worthwhile is a reasoned defense of one’s opinion. Your paper should be written to present rational argument for the position which you hold.</p>
<p>Your paper should consist of two parts. The first part (4 to 5 pages) should be a short explication of the essay you have chosen. This part should contain a statement of the author’s position, a statement of your own position (tell me whether you agree or disagree with the author) and an explanation of the author’s supporting arguments. The second half of the paper should consist of your own evaluation or critique of the essay. In this part of the paper, you should tell me WHY you agree or disagree with the author. If you agree with the author, you should tell me what argument(s) are convincing. Then tell me what argument(s) might be proffered by one who disagrees with the author and how the author might respond. If you disagree with the author, you should provide criticism of the author’s essay and attempt to explain how the author might respond to the criticism. Hence, whether you agree or disagree with the author, you should provide arguments against the author and responses thereto. Finally, you should explain why you believe your position is the best position. You must NOT use outside sources for this essay.</p>
<p><strong><em>Late Policy:</em></strong> Your paper must be turned in by the end of class on the date that it is due. Five points will be deducted for every twenty-four-hour period when a paper is late. Thus, if a paper is turned in at 8:00 p.m. on the date that it is due, five points will be deducted. If a paper is turned in at 8:00 p.m. on the day following the day that it is due, ten points will be deducted. This policy is in effect so that diligent students are not penalized. Due date for paper: All papers must be turned in by the end of class on Thursday, April 25th.</p>
</section>
<section id="examinations" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="examinations">Examinations</h4>
<p>The scheduled examinations will cover lectures, discussions and readings covered during the classes that precede it. You are responsible for assigned readings without regard to whether they were covered in class. The final examinations will cover the lectures, discussions and readings from the whole term, but will concentrate on those topics covered after the midterm examination.</p>
<p>I generally do not give make-up examinations. I believe that doing so penalizes those who diligently prepare for class. There are several conditions, however, under which I will consider a make-up: 1) A student is sick during the exam, calls me before the exam, and provides me with a doctor’s note certifying that s/he was sick; 2) A major tragedy, like a death in the student’s family, which somehow denies the student the opportunity to prepare for or attend the examination; 3) The student has a conflicting university obligation (s/he should know about this well in advance of the examination and provide me with documentation); or 4) Some other reason, which I deem to be a justifiable cause for non-attendance.</p>
